## /about

```
$ whoami
Minhaj Shafin

$ principles
make it work  →  make it clean  →  make it obvious

$ fun_fact
I don't chase perfection — I chase “easy to maintain at 2am”.
```

## /now

- Building, iterating, and keeping the diffs pleasantly small.
- Learning something new every week (and re-learning it on Monday).

## /toolbox

| Category | Things I reach for |
| --- | --- |
| Languages | Python • JavaScript/TypeScript • whatever the project needs |
| Interests | automation • tooling • web • clean UX • performance |
| Style | minimal • readable • boring-in-a-good-way |


## /collab

If you're building something useful (or delightfully unnecessary), I'm happy to chat.

PS: If this README looks calm, it's because the chaos is neatly organized.
